# About This Project

This project aims to relearn Laravel fundamentals while focusing on creating a well-structured directory layout. It replicates key features of Twitter's blogging functionality and Facebook Marketplace, but with more advanced capabilities.

## Views Directory Structure

- **Components Folder**: Contains `<x-ComponentName>` elements. These are reusable components used throughout the application.
- **Partials Folder**: Contains small, reusable templates for sections of the site that are repeated frequently.
- **Layout Folder**: Contains `app.blade.php`, the main layout file, which will be used as the base template for all pages in the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS** + **DaisyUI**: For responsive and customizable UI components.
- **Livewire**: For dynamic front-end interactions within Laravel without writing JavaScript.
